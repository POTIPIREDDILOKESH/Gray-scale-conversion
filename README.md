Image Filter

This is a Java project that provides a set of image filters to manipulate images. It includes functions to convert an image to grayscale, apply pixelation, Gaussian blur, and detect edges using the Sobel algorithm.

Features:

*Load an image from a file
*Convert the image to grayscale
*Apply 2x2 pixelation to a grayscale image
*Apply nxn pixelation to a grayscale image (nxn can be specified by the user)
*Scale a grayscale image to a new height while maintaining aspect ratio
*Apply 3x3 Gaussian blur to a grayscale image
*Apply 5x5 Gaussian blur to a grayscale image
*Detect edges of a grayscale image using the Sobel algorithm
*Brighten a color image by a specified percentage
